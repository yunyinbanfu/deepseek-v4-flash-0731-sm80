"""Gating and entry point for the int8 compressed prefill all-reduce (task #35).

The prefill all-reduces are hoisted out of RowParallelLinear and the MoE runner
into the decoder layer so they can be transported as int8 + one bf16 scale per
32 elements, halving the wire. mhc_post then consumes the quantized form
directly; a bf16 phase 2 would hand back half the saving.

Everything here is decided ONCE at construction, because suppressing the
downstream all-reduces is itself a construction-time decision -- `reduce_results`
is read when the layer is built, long before any per-forward token count exists.
That asymmetry is the whole reason this module exists: the set of all-reduce
sites we suppress must exactly equal the set the decoder layer re-adds, and
those two sets would otherwise be computed in different files, by different
mechanisms, under different names.

A missing all-reduce and a double all-reduce are both silent -- wrong numerics,
no crash -- and both are indistinguishable from a quality regression in the
serving gate. So the rule this module enforces is: **verify the resolved
outcome, never predict it.**
