"""CPU tests for the decode half of the indexer query shard: the query-group
partition, the batch-absolute row offsets it writes at, its gate, and the
float32 reduction that reassembles the batch.

Runs without a GPU on purpose, like its prefill sibling

top-k rows, or a rank-dependent decision that hangs the per-layer collective),
so the guards must not depend on scarce hardware. Imports the shipped helpers
