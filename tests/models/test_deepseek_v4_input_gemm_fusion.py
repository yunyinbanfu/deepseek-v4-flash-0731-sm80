"""`fuse_input_gemm_weights` merges the three bf16 attention input GEMMs.

The method is exercised unbound against a stub carrying only the attributes it
reads, so the test needs no model, no config and no weights on disk. What it
has to pin is that the merge is a re-layout and not a copy: after fusing, each
module's weight must be the same values it had, backed by the concatenated
buffer, because `attn_gemm_parallel_execute` splits that buffer's output by
those same row counts and the un-fused fallback still reads the module weights.

    Correctness gate for VLLM_UNREPLICATE_ATTN_GEMMS. Rows are partitioned,

    and the zero padding never leaks into the kept rows. Ragged widths are
    covered because prefill batches are not multiples of the TP size.

    On the *exactness* of the result: at every width the flag actually runs at
    (>= _UNREPLICATE_MIN_TOKENS) this is bit-identical, which is why the
    threshold is asserted here and not only in the perf argument.

    Below the threshold only the partition is pinned, not the arithmetic. The
    balanced split hands some ranks a 1-row GEMM at tiny widths, and a 1-row
    matmul takes a different library path than a 9-row one, so the fp32
    results diverge by more than bf16 rounding absorbs. That is a property of
    the BLAS and it is unreachable in production — the flag does not engage
    below the threshold — so asserting numerics there would be pinning a
